### Step 1 - Access Rancher and Harbor Portals

a) With a Google Chrome browser, access Rancher Server URL (https://rancher.xx.xx.xx.xx.sslip.io). If you are greeted by an invalid SSL certificate error message, please follow the Note*.

b) Enter the admin credentials to login i.e. `Username: admin`  and `Password: system assigned strong password`. 

c) When it's successful, you will be landing on the Rancher Home page. 

d) Do the same for Harbor URL (https://harbor.yy.yy.yy.yy.sslip.io). You will then be led to Harbor login page. If you are greeted by an invalid SSL certificate error message, please follow the Note*.

e) Enter the admin credentials to login i.e. `Username: admin`  and `Password: system assigned strong password`.
