# Lab 1 B - Setting up Harbor as a proxy to SUSE  Registry and replicating images to Harbor

In this exercise, we'll continue from the previous step of Lab 1 A. We'll create a new registry endpoint of SUSE Registry in Harbor. 

###### Usecase: Build the same confidence as enterprise demands by using tested and certified ready-to-go for enterprise use base container images. SUSE managed images are up-to-date with the latest security patches and features/functionalities are consistent with the base OS releases. Replicating images from SUSE Registry to the private registry will ensure that developers are using images from a single source (Harbor in this case) which is secured and access controls are provided as per the organisation's policy.

## Action 1: Create SUSE Registry's Endpoint in Harbor

This action will involve 5 steps from 1B.1 to 1B.5

**Step 1B.1)** Ensure that you are logged in to the Harbor (Refer to the Step 1 of section Before We Begin). 

**Step 1B.2)** Click on `Registries` from the lefst side menu under the **Administration**. Now click on `+ NEW ENDPOINT` from Registris screen

**Step 1B.3)** A pop-up screen will appear to fill in the following details and then click on `TEST CONNECTION`

`Provider : Docker Registry (From dropdown)`

`Name : user's choice e.g. suse-registry`

`Endpoint URL : https://registry.suse.com`

`Access ID : null` 

`Access Secret : null`

After filling the correct details, you'll receive an inline message `Connection tested successfully` on top of the pop-up window. Click `OK` .

## Action 2: Replicate container image to Harbor

This action will involve 5 steps from 1B.6 to 1B.10

**Step 1B.5)** Click on `Replications` from the left side menu under the **Administration**

**Step 1B.7)** Fill following details and click on `SAVE`

`Name : as per user's choice e.g. suse-registry-to-harbor`

`Replication method : Pull-based`

`Destination registry : select endpoint value from dropdown e.g. suse-registry - https://registry.suse.com`

`Name : bci/bci-base`

`Tag : latest`

`Trigger Method : Manual (default from dropdown)`

`Override : Checked`

**End of Action 2**



## Action 3: Scan replicated base container image (bci) bci/bci-base:latest 

This action will involve 3 steps from 1B.11 to 1B.13. 



**Step 1B.11)** Click on `Projects` from the left side menu.  Verify that `bci` is listed under **Project Name** column. Click on `bci` link.
