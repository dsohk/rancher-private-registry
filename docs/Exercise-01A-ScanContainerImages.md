# Lab 1 A - Scanning container image for vulnerabilities through Trivy on Harbor

In this exercise, we are login to the harbor portal and using native scanning tool Trivy for vulnarabilities. It has 2 main steps loging the harbor portal and scanning pre-loaded container image for vulnarabilities. 

###### Usecase: With the growing awareness about supply chain security, it is important to gain visibility into the software components used in the application. Scanning container images gives insight about the known vulnarabilities and and related fixes.   

## Action 1: Scan pre-loaded container image rancher's hello-world:latest

This action will involve 5 steps from 1A.1 to 1A.5 

**Step 1A.1)** Ensure that you are logged in to the Harbor (Refer to the Step 1 of section Before We Begin). On Harbor Home page, click the `library` link on main screen under **Project Name** column.
